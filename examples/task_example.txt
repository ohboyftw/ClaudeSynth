Implement a new FastAPI endpoint `/api/v1/products/{product_id}/stock` that allows updating the stock level of a product. It should accept a PATCH request with a JSON body like `{"change": -5}` to decrease stock or `{"change": 10}` to increase it. The endpoint must handle cases where the product is not found (404) and where the stock would become negative (400 Bad Request). It should return the updated product data.
